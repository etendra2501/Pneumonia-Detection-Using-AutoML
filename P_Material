Project Submission
After training each model, you need to fill out the AutoML Modeling Report. You can download this at the bottom of this page or as a pdf file under the lesson resources tab as AutoML Modeling Report.

Your project will be graded against this project rubric. Each item on the rubric will be graded by a reviewer and marked as Passed or Needs Changes. You may resubmit your project if it does not pass, but it is recommended that you try to stick to the suggested deadline for project completion.

Submitted Files
To complete and pass the project, you will have to submit a zip file that contains the following:

A completed AutoML Modeling Report.
Any screenshots the report asks for that you were unable to include as images in the report directly.
